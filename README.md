# Membership Registration System
## 📋 Description
This membership registration platform is designed for Agape Force Ministry, CGMi N. E. Bishopric Headquarters (Solution House), specifically aimed at facilitating the formal induction of teens into the faith-based community. The website spans two pages and is crafted with simplicity and efficiency in mind, adhering to modern web standards.

### Process Overview
- **Streamlined Registration Form:** Users are greeted with a simple and intuitive registration form.
- **HTML Validation:** The form employs built-in HTML validation techniques to ensure the data is accurate and complete before submission.
- **Front-End Only Solution:** No back-end technologies (_Node.js_, *PHP*, or *traditional server*) are required for validation, reducing complexity.
- **Email Submission:** After validation, the form data is sent directly to a designated email address.
- **Confirmation Page:** Upon successful submission, users are redirected to a confirmation page that acknowledges their registration and provides further instructions.
- **Lightweight Design:** This approach reduces technical overhead, making it ideal for community-driven membership portals.
