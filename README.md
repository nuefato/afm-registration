# Membership Registration System
##  Description
This is a 2-page membership registration website for Agape Force Ministry, CGMi N. E. Bishopric Headquarters (Solution House), offering teens a platform to get formally inducted into their faith-based community. The user is greeted with a registeration form, which validates using HTML validation techniques and then submits to an email address (all in front-end), thus eliminating the need for Javascript, PHP, or a traditional server validation and submission. After a user has been validated, it refers them to a success page.
